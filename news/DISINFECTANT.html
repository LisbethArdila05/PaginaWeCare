            <h2>WHAT IS DISINFECTANT FOGGING?</h2>
            <p>The disinfectant fog nebulization is a method of sterilization of spaces, which by means of a machine called nebulizer, is able to disinfect environments by spraying disinfectant liquid in tiny drops, thus forming a cloud that completely disinfects the place.

            This is how this method provides a clean area of contaminating agents, stopping the transmission of diseases. At this point, it is vital to clarify that its effect is not only limited to surfaces, but also helps to clean the air of the place.</p>

            <h2>HOW DOES DISINFECTION WITH FOGGERS WORK?</h2>
            <p>Now… How are disinfections of environments carried out with foggers?

            Before talking about the process, it is important to keep in mind that the doses of disinfectant and the use of products regulated by the sanitary system are of great importance for the work.

            Let’s remember that this is a professional service, so regulation is vital to offer good results, and safe spaces.

            But how does disinfection with foggers work?

            First of all, before spreading the disinfectant, the area must be evacuated; and the person in charge must wear protection, to avoid breathing the chemical while spreading it all over the area where it will be applied.

            Foggers work by means of electric motors, which are powerful enough to pump large quantities of disinfectant mist. Thus, the entire space will be covered with the product.

            After some time, the disinfectant will take effect on the surfaces reached; eliminating all traces of microorganisms that may exist in the environment and leaving a totally sterilized space.

            When the mist dissipates, the area can be accessed without any problem, but following the indications of the qualified personnel and avoiding entering the space too soon.

            And that’s all, it is that easy to have pathogen-free spaces with disinfectant fogging.
