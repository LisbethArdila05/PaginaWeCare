            <p>And when we talk about deep cleaning, we mean a complete cleaning of all environments, which also includes their respective objects and furniture.

            Although many do not believe it, sometimes our cleaning routines are not enough to keep our environments free of dirt and bacteria; and although we think that with some cleaning practices we can stop contamination, in most cases, this is not so.
            
            If we want to have a clean, hygienic and bacteria-free space, we need to look for professionals capable of offering us a complete deep cleaning service.
            
            Have you ever heard about this type of cleaning?
            
            Keep reading this article, and find out what deep cleaning is and why you should opt for this cleaning service for your environments.</p>

            <h2>WHAT IS A DEEP CLEANING SERVICE?</h2>
            <p>The deep cleaning service, the worst enemy of dirt.

            Deep cleaning is a complete cleaning service that employs professional tools and supplies on a large scale to eradicate all traces of dirt from rooms.

            This type of cleaning differs from conventional cleaning methods because of all the processes involved.
                
            With traditional cleaning the work time is shorter, and so is the number of supplies used; whereas with deep cleaning the work can last more than 8 hours, and even specialized chemical supplies and industrial machinery are used.</p>
