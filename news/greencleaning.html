            <p>Have you ever heard about ecological cleaning?

            We live in an era where there is more and more social awareness about environmental pollution, and its negative effects on the planet; that is why efforts are created to find alternatives that do not contribute more to ecological damage and are friendly to the environment.
            
            This is the origin of what we know today as “Green clean”.
            
            Would you like to know more about this cleaning method and why you should start implementing it?
            
            Keep reading this article, and discover green cleaning, a sustainable way of cleaning that will help you take care of the planet</p>
        </div>
        <div class="article-sig">
            <h2>WHAT IS GREEN CLEANING?</h2>
            <p>When we talk about green cleaning, we refer to the result of the growing trend to use cleaning supplies and materials that are safe for health and the environment.

            It is a cleaning model that uses resources with little or no environmental damage, fighting pollution and taking care of the planet.
                
            The products used in an ecological cleaning have less toxic ingredients than the conventional ones; besides, some of them are made with 100% natural materials, which of course is better for the environment.
                
            However, having an environmentally safe green cleaning involves a lot of responsibility, and is conditioned to different policies, procedures and personnel training.
                
            It is not enough just to use the products, in a green cleaning it is crucial to understand why certain inputs are used, and the damage to health generated by conventional methods, in order to ensure protection to people and the environment.</p>

            <h2>WHY SHOULD YOU OPT FOR GREEN CLEANING?</h2>
            <p>Green cleaning is booming, and although many doubts its effectiveness, it really is a model of grooming that is very beneficial for those who buy it.

            Do you have doubts about whether or not to opt for an ecological cleaning?
                
            Here are some of the reasons why you should give sustainable alternatives a chance and decide to go green:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>Green cleaning improves indoor air quality.</span>
                    <p>By not resorting to concentrated products or products with toxic components, green cleaning does not pollute indoor air, thus improving its quality and does not represent a health risk.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>It avoids infections and diseases.</span>
                    <p>The ecological cleanings not only take care of the health by fighting the dirt in the environments, they also do it by means of the inputs that they use. Green cleaning products are non-toxic, so they are not harmful to the people who handle them or to those who pass through the space to be cleaned.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Doing something good for the planet.</span>
                    <p>The production and use of conventional cleaning products are really an attack on the environment, causing a high degree of pollution. With environmentally friendly products this does not happen, as they have a mostly natural composition, which does not result in environmental damage</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>HOW IS AN ECOLOGICAL CLEANING DONE?</h2>
            <label>It is vital to understand something:

            Green cleanings are based on the type of products used in the grooming procedures.
                
            These products, as we have already mentioned, are eco-friendly cleaning products that contribute to environmental care, and do not have pollutants among their ingredients.
                
            So a green cleaning follows the same steps as a conventional cleaning, except that biodegradable and environmentally friendly products are used.
                
            Among these ecological supplies are the following:</label>
            <ul>
                <li>Ecological disinfectants.</li>
                <li>Green floor cleaners.</li>
                <li>Ecological window cleaners.</li>
                <li>Microfiber mops and microfiber cloths.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As we can see, these are normal items in a cleaning process, but they do not contain toxic agents; and although some people think that as they are biodegradable products they are not efficient, the reality is that they work in an incredible way.</p>
