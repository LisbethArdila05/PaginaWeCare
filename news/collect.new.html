            <h2>WHAT IS WASTE?</h2>
            <p>When we talk about waste, we refer to any material that is discarded by a person after losing its usefulness; and that in turn can be in liquid, solid and gaseous state.

            There are different types of waste, which can be classified:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>According to their biodegradable composition:</span>
                    <p>This group is determined by organic waste, which can decompose very quickly and serve as nutrients to the soil; and by inorganic waste, which are materials that take years to decompose, thus damaging the entire environment</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>According to its origin:</span>
                    <p>Waste varies according to its place of origin, which is classified into 4 zones: household, municipal, hospital, construction, and industrial.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>According to its composition:</span>
                    <p>The composition of waste speaks to what makes it up, and in solid waste, the classification by composition is as follows: Cardboard, glass, paper, plastic, batteries, and metal.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>An interesting fact is that due to the problem of how to dispose of waste, several countries have adopted the classification of garbage by type, thus facilitating its reuse and disposal, which has helped to give a second life to many discarded materials.

                </li>
                <li>
